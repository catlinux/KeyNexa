# Changelog

[English](CHANGELOG.md) | [Español](docs/es/CHANGELOG.md)

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.3] - 2026-10-13

### Added

- Release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): on a `vX.Y.Z` tag it checks the tag against `VERSION` and `CHANGELOG.md`, builds the release APK, signs it with the repository secrets, and publishes a GitHub release (pre-release before 1.0) with the APK and its SHA-256 file.
- Documentation of how to create the signing keystore and the four repository secrets.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-10-13

### Added

- Continuous integration with GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): build and quality checks, bilingual-documentation check, dependency-license report and an OSV vulnerability scan.
- `scripts/check-docs-i18n.sh`, which fails when an English document has no Spanish translation or vice versa, or when a language line is missing.
- The Gradle License Report plugin, wired into `generateLicenseReport` for all subprojects.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-13

### Added

- Quality checks wired into `./gradlew check`: ktlint (with `ktlintFormat` to auto-correct), detekt and hardened Android Lint in both Android modules, where `HardcodedText`, `MissingTranslation`, `ExtraTranslation` and the security checks are errors.
- Gradle dependency verification: every dependency, plugin and tool is verified against the SHA-256 checksums in `gradle/verification-metadata.xml`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-13

### Added

- Multi-module Gradle skeleton (phase C1): the Kotlin/JVM 17 modules `core-vault`, `core-kdbx` and `core-sync`, the Android library `platform-android` and the Compose + Material 3 application `app-android`, with a version catalog and a trivial JUnit test per module.
- `app-android` takes its `versionName` from `VERSION` and derives `versionCode` from it; the manifest disables backups and declares no permission, and the interface strings are provided in `en-US` and Spanish only through string resources.
- Verified build, test and packaging instructions in `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-10-13

### Added

- ADR-0005: kotpass is kept, vendored as a module and reinforced (differential tests against KeePassXC and keepass-rs, fuzzing, XML-preservation fixes, optional native Argon2), after re-evaluating kotpass, KeePassJava2, keepass-rs and kdbxweb.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-13

### Changed

- Spanish translations moved to `docs/es/`, mirroring the English structure; only `README.es.md` stays in the root. Language links and the bilingual rules in CONTRIBUTING updated.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-13

### Added

- Research and architecture phase (phases A and B): architecture, threat model, dependency and license research, roadmap with MVP acceptance criteria, development plan and architecture decision records 0001–0004.
- License: GPL-3.0-only with additional attribution and trademark terms (section 7) in `NOTICE`; `CREDITS.md`.
- Project documentation in English and Spanish: README, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CHANGELOG, TODO.
- `VERSION` file.
